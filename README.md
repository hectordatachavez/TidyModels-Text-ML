# `Hello, World!` 

This is part of a series of posts/repositories in which I explore the use of different tools relevant for my work as social-environmental impact research, ranging from visualizations to predictive modeling using \#TidyTuesday or other open datasets.

## What is this about?

This is a project I made inspired by a screencast on a \#TidyTuesday dataset. With it, I wanted to practice using the [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) R package and modeling framework; practice engineering features from text.

## What are my references?

This projects is inspired by the [Apr 23, 2021 screecast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYj8vyK864Y) of the fabulous ðŸŒŸ[Julia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge?tab=repositories) ðŸŒŸ. In that post, Julia walks through how to build features from text for tidy-modeling. I learned a lot, got inspired, and made this post.

Thank you, Julia ðŸ¦„ !

I also used chapters from the forthcoming book, [*Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R*](https://smltar.com/)**,** by [*Emil Hvitfeldt*](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt) *& J[ulia Silge](https://github.com/juliasilge).* (Cannot wait to have a physical copy of this book! I'm old school.)
